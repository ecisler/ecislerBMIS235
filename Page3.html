        <p class="description">It has been long debated about who is the best golfer of all time. 
            <br> Most say Tiger woods. He has 82 PGA Tour wins and has made the cut 339/378 times. He has earned 1.8 billion dollars over the course of his career. He held the number one in the world title for 281 consecutive weeks and 683 total weeks.
            <br> Some say that Jack Nicklaus is the best. Adjusting for inflation, Nicklaus had over 31 million dollars in career earnings.He has 73 career wins and made the cut 495/584 times.
            <br> Recently, golf fans have started to believe that the greatest is Scottie Scheffler. He has been on the tour for four years and has 17 career wins and has made the cut 111/130 times. He has earned over 70 million dollars over his short career. Scottie has held the number one spot for 108 weeks.
            <br> To me, the best golfer of all time is Fat Perez. Perez is a YouTube golf sensation. He has won multiple club championships and amateur tournaments. Perez has played in one PGA Tour qualifier and unfortunately did not make the cut. He has zero professional earnings and has never been number one in the world. Although the stats are not comparable, Perez's influence on the game is unmatched.
