        <p class="description">Since golf takes most up almost 25% of the day, why would anyone play? 
            <br> The answer is simple. Golf is fun...until it isn't.
            <br> Golf is a true roller coaster. You can hit one good shot and be on top of the world. 
            <br> Your next shot could end up in the woods, in the lake, or three feet in front of you. 
            <br> That's when you feel like throwing your clubs in the water and never playing this game again.
